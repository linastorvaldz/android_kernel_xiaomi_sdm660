/* The rt_load is used to get the number of rt processes per CPU

 */

The user call ioctl to obtain the number of rt processes per CPU.
As shown as the below:
#define RTLOAD_IOCTL_MAGIC         'L'
#define RTLOAD_IOCTL_LOAD_GET      _IO(RTLOAD_IOCTL_MAGIC,  1)

The user use struct rtload_load_stat to get result:
struct rtload_stat {
	int topprio; /*rt process highest priority*/
	int num;     /*number of rt processes*/
};
Notice:Each cpu core must define a struct rtload_load_stat.
